Stress can come with your first job as a developer, which I knew, but the type of stress I felt was worse than I could have imagined. Working for a small start-up, I was given a small full-stack project that I could have done even if it had not been given to me in a job setting. I have built plenty of landing pages and worked with databases before in my studies.

So why was it so different when it was for a company and not something I was messing around with? Imposter syndrome set in hard with this project. In my brain, I couldn’t comprehend that I was working with a database I had never used and a language I am only familiar with. Which means mistakes will happen.

I did get the project done before the deadline, but the amount of stress and self-doubt I experienced was not needed when I accomplished the goal ahead of time. I could have even taken a break instead of plowing through it at full speed ahead.

The mentor developer even told me not to be hard on myself. I am so thankful for him; his kindness and patience got me through my first project.

So what have I learned from this experience? Well, we are much harder on ourselves than anyone else. My mistakes didn’t lose money and no one died. I took the fun of learning something new and replaced it with fear of messing up. Even though when I am learning, I mess up all the time. That is how you learn.

One of the reasons I love software development is because I get to learn new things all the time, and it’s totally fun for me.

I need to remind myself to have fun, that as long as the job gets done, it’s going to be okay, and to reach out when I need to.
