The fat positivity movement is garnering attention, but I’m concerned it might be detrimental to the health of our children. Now, before you label me as fatphobic, hear me out. I speak from experience. Being obese or overweight isn’t healthy, period. While the movement preaches self-acceptance, my own journey tells a different story. At 52, I find myself reliant on a wheelchair to leave my house due to excruciating pain that prohibits walking far distances. How did I reach this point? It’s been a lifelong struggle. As a child, I was already 110 pounds at 7 years old, hitting 252 pounds by age 12, and a staggering 506 pounds at my heaviest. Even after shedding some weight, I still hover between 370 to 400 pounds. My firsthand experience leads me to assert that the fat positivity movement might be causing more harm than good, especially for our children. It’s simply not true that you can be healthy at any weight.

The risks associated with obesity are well-documented, including heightened chances of various diseases and cancers. Even regular exercise can’t mitigate the toll on your body; I know this firsthand. I used to live on the 11th floor, often climbing those stairs when the elevator was out. But now, residing on the ground floor is a necessity. I’ve witnessed the decline in physical activity for children over the years, a stark contrast to my childhood spent outdoors. Sure, I’m a software developer student, spending hours glued to a computer screen, but I’ve realized the importance of staying active, even resorting to using a peddler under my desk. Sitting for extended periods isn’t just bad for your body; it’s bad for your overall well-being.

While I don’t blame anyone for the obesity epidemic, several factors have contributed to its prevalence. Our food landscape has changed drastically, with sugar infiltrating almost everything we consume. Research suggests that intermittent access to sugar can lead to addictive behaviors akin to substance abuse (Avena, Rada, & Hoebel, 2008). Additionally, sedentary lifestyles and the convenience of fast food exacerbate the issue. Mental health also plays a significant role, often overlooked in discussions about obesity. It’s not just about eating less and moving more; it’s about addressing underlying issues like low self-esteem, which can drive unhealthy eating habits.

Moreover, the cost of healthy food presents a significant barrier, particularly for those with limited resources. As someone on a tight budget relying on food stamps, I understand the struggle of stretching dollars to prioritize nutritious options over cheap, processed foods. Despite these challenges, I remain committed to improving my health. I’m pursuing a career in software development, incorporating intermittent fasting into my routine, and planning to seek professional help once I secure employment.

My message isn’t about shaming individuals for their weight but rather advocating for a holistic approach to health and self-care. We all deserve love and acceptance, regardless of our size. However, promoting the idea that it’s okay to be fat because you’re inherently healthy is misguided. Instead, let’s focus on loving ourselves and nurturing our bodies, irrespective of size. Our worth shouldn’t be tied to our appearance; every individual deserves to be valued and respected.

As for me, I continue to struggle with my weight, acknowledging the multifaceted nature of the issue. But I’m determined to make positive changes and prioritize my well-being. It’s a journey, but I’m committed to becoming the best version of myself.

In closing, let’s approach discussions about body positivity with nuance and consideration for the health implications, particularly for our children. No seven-year-old should weigh 110 pounds; let’s strive to create a culture that promotes health and self-love, not harmful misconceptions.

May we always strive to be the best version of ourselves.
