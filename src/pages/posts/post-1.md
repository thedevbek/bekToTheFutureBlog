When we embark on the journey of coding, there's an unmistakable thrill that we all share when we witness something materialize on our screens or terminals for the very first time. That sensation of almost god-like power, when we command a machine to do our bidding, is something we've all felt.

My introduction to the world of programming occurred when I enrolled in a 'Writing for the Web' course at Missouri State University. Little did I know that this seemingly unrelated class would have a profound impact on my career aspirations. Initially, I believed it would focus on writing articles for the internet rather than the academic papers I was used to. However, it turned out to be my first encounter with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I was immediately captivated by what I fondly refer to as the 'god mode.' There was no turning back, despite lurking apprehensions. I was hooked, and I thirsted for more knowledge.

You might be wondering, what fear am I talking about? Mathematics? My early education left much to be desired, and I had an aversion to anything related to math. Back in those days, calculators were seldom used until advanced math classes. I erroneously associated programming and computer-related careers with mathematical genius, a label I certainly didn't bear. However, my 'Writing for the Web' class enlightened me. I realized I had to confront my math-related fears if I wanted to delve deeper into the world of programming.

I took a break from formal education to tackle my fear head-on, and I overcame it by recognizing that mathematics is essentially a puzzle to solve. As I reacquainted myself with mathematical concepts, I simultaneously delved into programming tutorials. I became obsessed with that 'god mode' feeling.

While these tutorials did impart many fundamental programming concepts, they also provided me with a deceptive sense of proficiency. I found the quickest way to rekindle that 'god mode' sensation was by watching and following tutorials. Little did I realize that I had fallen into what's commonly known as 'tutorial hell.' I believed I was making significant progress and even considered myself a competent junior web developer. Yet, despite grasping numerous fundamental programming principles, I hadn't learned how to apply them due to my over-reliance on tutorials.

When I decided to tackle my first independent project, a ToDo app without the aid of a tutorial, I felt utterly adrift. It was a humbling and eye-opening experience. This is when the reality of 'tutorial hell' truly hit me, and I comprehended how the videos hadn't equipped me as thoroughly as I had assumed.

Initially overwhelmed by this newfound understanding, I knew I needed a new approach. Giving up was never an option because I cherished that 'god mode' feeling; it was my driving force through the challenging and frustrating moments.

I sought invaluable advice from numerous developers on X, and their guidance was straightforward yet tremendously valuable: build things and read the documentation. If I needed to learn something, I could watch a tutorial without actively following along and then immediately replicate what I had seen, without revisiting the video.

I came to the realization that I didn't need to start from scratch all over again; I had already grasped the foundational concepts. What I needed to do was put that knowledge into practice, as there might come a day when I would be crafting documentation for a new product, with no videos or documentation to lean on.

So, if you find yourself ensnared in 'tutorial hell,' take a pause and start building something. Utilize the research skills you've acquired and combine them with thorough documentation reading to create something substantial. Once you do that, you'll fully appreciate how powerful that 'god mode' feeling can be, as it becomes more intense with each achievement.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my friends on X, who helped me realize the importance of promptly applying the concepts I learned to solidify the knowledge I had acquired. Without the incredible TechX community, formerly known as TechTwitter, I might still be blissfully ignorant in the clutches of 'tutorial hell.'
