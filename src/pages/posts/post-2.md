No one is more surprised than I am to be growing on X-Twitter. I didn’t join X for financial gain but to connect with fellow Devs and tech enthusiasts . My bishop said I needed to start networking, and I thought that X-Twitter would be a good place. If I ran into the toxic Twitter I have heard of then I would just call that person or group out and then bail. There are other platforms to network on.

My experience with X-Twitter has been wonderful. I have only experienced one troll, a sad troll that I think was crushing on me or something. Not sure what he was doing, and I hope he was a bot because that person was very unhappy.

Yesterday, I asked if anyone had anything they wanted to know about because I wanted to write another post about something. Well, I was completely surprised when about three people said to write about how I am growing so rapidly on X-Twitter. I was like, ‘Me?’

I think I am growing exceptionally fast on here but I never thought I’d get more than just a few people to follow me. So when these friends suggested I write about it, I had to give it some serious thought.

Because I am not sure, I am not actively trying to grow but am grateful for the growth I’ve experienced. I don’t ponder how to go viral on X. But here is what I am doing that seems to be working in my favor for now, at least.

1.  I typically post things that interest me, and I ask a lot of questions — I mean a lot. That’s just who I am. You can call me Curious George if you’re old enough to remember.
2.  I try to follow all the tech people I can find and don’t want to be one of the people who have thousands of followers but only subscribe to a few. Not that there is anything wrong with it. It’s just not my style, and again I want to reach out to the tech-twitter community. I have met some amazingly kind and brilliant people on this platform.
3.  I am completely authentic. I don’t have the time or energy to have a different personality on X-Twitter than I do in real life. I want to be liked for who I am and not what I think people want me to be. I have spent most of my life living that way and I refuse to go back to that ever. I know I am not everyone’s cup of tea. Which is a part of human nature, but I don’t try to deliberately be a jackass or mean. But we all have bad days, mine are getting fewer and fewer, thankfully.
4.  I always strive to be kind and helpful. I also appreciate people who have shown kindness and support to me.
5.  Lastly, I love to make people laugh, and I am usually trying to get a chuckle out of someone by saying something silly I think is funny. People probably chuckle at me and not what I am saying because they are laughing at the fact I thought that was funny.

So for the people who have asked me what I am doing to grow on X-Twitter, I guess just being myself and not looking for anything other than a true connection and limited shitposts. I hope this can in some ways help you be who you are on this platform. As an introvert, I find it hard sometimes, but the benefit is truly outweighing the negative stuff in my head.

It has taken me my entire life to stop trying to be what others want me to be and to be who I am meant to be. People come and go in your life for a reason and a season, so they will on X-Twitter. But the ones who want to stay will, and those are the relationships you need to cultivate. At least that is what I am trying to do.

I do have a bad habit of calling people out about something I think is weird. Not to be mean and evil but to express my feelings and hopefully give them another perspective. I will probably lose a lot of followers from my last post, and that is okay, but I won’t lose my ‘real friends’ because we can talk about it and have an understanding we all have different beliefs and come from all over the world, so it’s natural to have different beliefs but we don’t have to have the same beliefs and still be friends.

To wrap this up before I get more philosophical, I suppose I’ve grown on X-Twitter because I stay true to myself and consistently strive to be kind.
