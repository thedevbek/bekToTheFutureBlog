    No one is more surprised than I am to be growing on X(Twitter) . I didn’t join X(Twitter)  for financial gain but to connect with fellow deveopers and tech enthusiasts. I had slight fear about running into toxic X(Twitter), but I could handle it.
</p>

<p>
    Yesterday, I asked if anyone had anything they wanted to know about because I wanted to write another post about something. Since I am new to blogging, ideas have been hard to come by. When a few people said to write about how I am growing so rapidly on X(Twitter). I was like, ‘Who Me?’ I didn't realize I had been. 
</p>

<p>
    I am not actively trying to grow but am grateful for the growth I’ve experienced. I sit around pondering how to go viral on X. But here is what I am doing that seems to be working in my favor.
</p>

<p>
    I typically post things that interest me, and I ask a lot of questions — I mean a lot. That’s just who I am. You can call me, Curious George, if you’re old enough to remember the character.
</p>

<p>
    I try to follow all the tech people I can find. I want to reach out to the tech-X(Twitter) community. I have met some kind and brilliant people on this platform. What I have learned is to not randomly follow everyone, but to be dicerning on those I do follow. Also, have some interaction with them before following them. 
</p>

<p>
    I am completely authentic. I don’t have the time, patience, or energy to have a different personality on X(Twitter) than I do in real life. I want to be liked for who I am and not what I think people want me to be. I have spent most of my life living that way and I refuse to go back to that ever. I know I am not everyone’s cup of tea which is just apart of being human.
</p>

<p>
    So for the people who have asked me what I am doing to grow on X(Twitter), I guess just being myself and not looking for anything other than a true connection. I hope this can in some ways help you be who you are on this platform. As an introvert, I find it hard sometimes, but the benefit is truly outweighing the negative stuff in my head.
</p>

<p>
    It has taken me my entire life to stop trying to be what others want me to be and to be who I am meant to be. People come and go in your life for a reason and a season, so they will on X(Twitter). But the ones who want to stay will, and those are the relationships you need to cultivate. At least that is what I am trying to do.
</p>

<p>
    To wrap this up before I get more philosophical, I suppose I’ve grown on X(Twitter) because I stay true to myself and consistently strive to be kind.
